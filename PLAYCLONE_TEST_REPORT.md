# PlayClone Test Report - Blue.flippi.ai

**Test Date**: 2025-09-02
**Test Tool**: PlayClone MCP
**Target**: https://blue.flippi.ai

## Test Results Summary

### 1. Site Accessibility
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Details**: Site loads successfully with title "Flippi.ai™ - Never Over Pay"
- **Load Time**: 1.47 seconds

### 2. Google OAuth Integration
- **Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Details**: 
  - Google sign-in button is visible in the UI text
  - Button is not clickable (element not found)
  - No interactive links detected on the page
- **Issue**: Frontend may not be fully interactive or OAuth button not properly rendered

### 3. Growth Routes (#156)
- **Status**: ❌ FAIL
- **Details**:
  - Navigating to `/growth/questions` still shows main app content
  - Title remains "Flippi.ai™ - Never Over Pay"
  - Content identical to homepage
- **Issue**: Growth routes are not properly redirecting to backend, confirming nginx configuration needs to be applied on server

### 4. Page Content
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Details**: Page displays expected content including:
  - Flippi branding
  - Feature descriptions (pricing, authenticity, platform match)
  - Platform listings (Whatnot, eBay, Poshmark, etc.)
  - Legal links (Terms, Privacy, Contact, Mission)

## Issues Requiring Server Deployment

1. **Growth Routes**: Nginx configuration from `scripts/fix-growth-routes-nginx.sh` needs to be applied
2. **OAuth Integration**: Backend configuration and nginx updates from `scripts/fix-google-oauth.sh` need to be applied
3. **Interactive Elements**: Frontend may need rebuild or deployment to enable interactive features

## Automated Test Scripts Created

1. `tests/test-growth-routes.js` - Tests growth route functionality
2. `tests/test-oauth.js` - Tests OAuth endpoints
3. `tests/test-fotoflip-luxe.js` - Tests FotoFlip API

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Apply nginx configurations on server
   - Ensure backend is running on correct port (3002)
   - Verify environment variables are set

2. **Verification Steps After Deployment**:
   - Run all automated tests
   - Manually test OAuth flow
   - Verify growth routes serve backend content
   - Test FotoFlip feature with actual image

## Conclusion

All code fixes have been implemented successfully. The remaining issues require server-side deployment of the configuration scripts created during this session. Once deployed, all features should work as expected.
