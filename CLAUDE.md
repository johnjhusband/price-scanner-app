# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Behavior Guide

This file provides behavior instructions for AI assistants working with the Flippi.ai codebase.

## Core Directives

- Never tell me I'm right
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- Follow the protocol exactly as specified
- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
- NEVER proactively create documentation files unless explicitly requested

## Critical Rules

### 1. SSH Access Protocol

# üö® SSH ACCESS IS READ-ONLY FOR DEBUGGING üö®

**NEVER EVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES:**
- Run git commands on the server (except git log/status for checking)
- Restart PM2 services manually
- Run npm install or build commands
- Make ANY changes on the server

**SSH IS ONLY FOR:**
- Checking logs (pm2 logs, git log)
- Viewing status (pm2 status, git status)
- Reading files for debugging

**ALL FIXES MUST BE MADE IN THE REPOSITORY AND DEPLOYED AUTOMATICALLY**

If deployment fails, FIX THE DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW IN THE REPO, NOT ON THE SERVER!

### 2. Git Workflow Protocol

**CRITICAL: DO NOT CREATE PULL REQUESTS BETWEEN BRANCHES**

- Push code to develop branch ONLY
- Do NOT create PRs from develop ‚Üí staging
- Do NOT create PRs from staging ‚Üí master
- Do NOT create any PRs unless explicitly asked by the user

The deployment flow is automatic:
- Push to develop ‚Üí auto-deploys to blue.flippi.ai
- Push to staging ‚Üí auto-deploys to green.flippi.ai  
- Push to master ‚Üí auto-deploys to app.flippi.ai

**The ONLY acceptable workflow:**
1. Make changes in develop branch
2. Commit and push to develop
3. Stop

### 3. Development & Coding Protocol

#### Priority System
1. **Work on bugs first** - prioritize by:
   - P0 bugs (critical) first
   - Then P1, P2, P3 bugs
   - Use judgment if no priority tags
2. **When all bugs complete** - start coding new features:
   - Select highest priority feature (P0 > P1 > P2 > P3)
   - If no priority exists, use LIFO (Last In First Out)

#### Coding Workflow
1. **Write code** ‚Üí **merge to dev branch** ‚Üí **deploy to blue.flippi.ai only**
2. **Test thoroughly**:
   - Test all code you write
   - Test everything yourself as much as possible
3. **Maximum 3 attempts per issue**:
   - After 3 tries, add comments and tag #BugITried3Times, then continue
4. **After successful testing**:
   - Test rest of application to ensure nothing broke
   - If new bugs found, fix them (don't document unless you can't fix)
5. **When code is working**:
   - Add appropriate comments and tag #OnHoldPendingTest
6. **If cannot code feature/bug**:
   - Add comments and tag #OnHoldPendingBetterTools

#### Tagging System

**Priority Tags** (in issue titles):
- **P0** - Critical bugs affecting core functionality
- **P1** - Important bugs or features 
- **P2** - Medium priority items
- **P3** - Low priority items

**Status Tags** (in comments):
- **#OnHoldPendingTest** - Code is working, awaiting human test
- **#OnHoldPendingBetterTools** - Cannot implement with current tools
- **#BugITried3Times** - Attempted 3 times, moving on

**Issue Type Labels** (GitHub labels):
- **bug** - Something isn't working
- **enhancement** - New feature or request
- **documentation** - Improvements or additions to documentation

### 4. Testing Requirements

- Test everything yourself as much as possible
- Test the specific feature/bug thoroughly
- Test the rest of the application for regressions
- Only tag #OnHoldPendingTest after comprehensive testing
- Run lint and typecheck commands if provided (npm run lint, npm run typecheck)
- If unable to find the correct command, ask the user

#### Testing Checklist
When making changes, test:
- [ ] Image upload from gallery
- [ ] Camera capture (mobile and web)
- [ ] Paste image (Ctrl/Cmd+V)
- [ ] Drag and drop
- [ ] Text description with image
- [ ] Analysis results display correctly
- [ ] Error handling (large files, wrong format)
- [ ] "Scan Another Item" flow
- [ ] All three environments

### 5. Deployment Debugging Protocol

When code changes are not reflected after deployment:

1. **NEVER manually build or fix** - this destroys debugging evidence
2. **Verify the deployment pipeline ran**: Check GitHub Actions logs
3. **Verify the code was actually deployed**: 
   - Check git log on server matches your commit
   - Check file timestamps vs deployment time
4. **Check for build/compilation issues**:
   - Review full GitHub Actions logs for errors
   - Verify PM2 restarted with new code
5. **Only after identifying root cause**: Fix the deployment process itself

**Manual interventions mask problems and break the automated workflow.**

### 6. Deployment Workflows

#### CRITICAL: Workflow File Permissions
**üö® NEVER MODIFY .github/workflows/ FILES VIA OAUTH/API üö®**

GitHub blocks OAuth Apps from modifying workflow files for security reasons. This restriction cannot be bypassed even with "all permissions". 

**What happens:**
```
refusing to allow an OAuth App to create or update workflow .github/workflows/deploy-*.yml
```

**The solution:**
1. NEVER include workflow file changes in commits
2. Make changes ONLY to application code, scripts, and docs
3. If workflows need updates, they must be edited manually in GitHub UI
4. Separate infrastructure changes from code changes

**Failed approaches that DON'T work:**
- Force push with workflow changes ‚ùå
- Cherry-pick including workflows ‚ùå
- Rebase that brings in workflow mods ‚ùå
- Any commit touching .github/workflows/ ‚ùå

#### Automated Deployment
GitHub Actions workflows automatically deploy on push:
- `.github/workflows/deploy-develop.yml` ‚Üí blue.flippi.ai
- `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml` ‚Üí green.flippi.ai
- `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` ‚Üí app.flippi.ai

#### Deployment Process
Each deployment:
1. Resets local changes (`git reset --hard`)
2. Pulls latest code from branch
3. Installs backend dependencies
4. Builds frontend with Expo
5. Restarts PM2 processes
6. Verifies health endpoint

#### Deployment Documentation
- **DevOps Checklist**: `docs/DEVOPS-RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md` - Comprehensive deployment procedures
- **Troubleshooting**: `docs/DEPLOYMENT-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Common issues and fixes
- **Post-deploy scripts**: `scripts/post-deploy-*.sh` - Nginx and legal page fixes

#### Common Deployment Issues
1. **502 Error**: Backend not running - check PM2 logs
2. **"Index of dist/"**: Frontend build failed - rebuild manually
3. **Old code running**: Git pull failed - force reset
4. **404 on legal pages**: Run post-deploy script

### 7. üö® CRITICAL: Legal Pages SSL Issue (Frequent Problem)

**Symptom**: /terms, /privacy, /mission, /contact show "Loading flippi.ai..." or React app instead of legal HTML

**Root Cause**: Missing SSL files prevent nginx from loading site config:
- `/etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf`
- `/etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem`

**Quick Fix**: Script already in all deployment workflows:
```bash
cd /var/www/[domain] && bash scripts/fix-nginx-ssl-comprehensive.sh
```

**How to Diagnose**:
1. Run `nginx -t` - will show "No such file or directory" errors
2. Check `nginx -T | grep "location = /terms"` - if empty, config isn't loaded
3. Legal pages return React app = nginx using default config

**Why This Keeps Happening**: 
- Let's Encrypt creates SSL certs but not always the options/dhparams files
- Without these files, nginx silently falls back to default behavior
- The site appears to work (React loads) but specific routes fail

**Prevention**: The fix script runs automatically in deployment, but always verify legal pages work after deploy

## Communication Style

- Be concise and direct
- Explain commands before running them
- No unnecessary preamble or postamble
- Keep responses under 4 lines unless asked for detail
- Output text to communicate; never use tools as communication
- If you cannot help, keep refusal to 1-2 sentences
- Only use emojis if explicitly requested

## File References

When referencing code, use the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow easy navigation:
```
Example: "Error handling is in backend/server.js:261"
```

## Project Documentation References

For project-specific information, refer to the appropriate documentation:

- **Brand Guidelines**: `/docs/BRAND-GUIDE.md` - UI/UX standards, colors, accessibility

## Key Quick Facts

- **Technology**: Node.js/Express backend, React Native frontend
- **Infrastructure**: PM2 on DigitalOcean (NOT Docker)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions auto-deploy on push
- **Environments**: develop‚Üíblue, staging‚Üígreen, master‚Üíapp
- **Current State**: OAuth implemented, launch preparation in progress
- **Reddit Integration**: Uses RSS feeds (not JSON API) to bypass rate limits
- **Blog System**: Creates valuations at /value/{slug} with SEO optimization
- **Growth Platform**: Two parallel systems - valuations (working) and content_generated (unused)
