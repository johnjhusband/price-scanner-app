## Hunter's Comment (First Comment)
Hey Product Hunt! üëã

I'm Tara, a full-time reseller who was tired of:
- Missing profitable items because I didn't know their value
- Buying items that sat in my death pile for months
- Getting burned on fakes
- Spending hours researching comps on my phone

So I built Flippi - it's like having a reselling expert in your pocket who's analyzed millions of sales.

Last week alone, Flippi helped me:
- Score a $300 designer bag for $12 at an estate sale
- Avoid a fake Louis Vuitton at an auction
- Find trending items I never would have noticed

We just launched v2.0 with enhanced AI and I'd love your feedback! The app is free to try at app.flippi.ai

AMA about reselling, building AI apps, or how to spot valuable items! üéØ
