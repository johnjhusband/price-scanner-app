# OAuth Workflow Mismatch Issue

## Problem
The GitHub workflow is using old script names:
- `apply-staging-oauth-fix-debug.sh` (old)
- `apply-staging-oauth-fix.sh` (old)

But we've created new scripts:
- `fix-staging-oauth-verbose.sh` (new - with full diagnostics)
- `fix-staging-nginx-oauth.sh` (new - with exact ticket requirements)

## Solution Required
The workflow on GitHub needs to be updated to use the new script names, but workflow pushes are being blocked.

## Current Status
- OAuth still returns 200 on staging
- The old scripts may not have the correct nginx configuration
- The new scripts have proper validation but aren't being called

## Next Steps
1. Update the workflow on GitHub to use the new scripts
2. Or rename the new scripts to match what the workflow expects
