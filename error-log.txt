Backend Container Error Log
=========================
Date: 2025-07-07
Issue: Backend container fails to start

Error Message:
--------------
Error: Cannot find module 'compression'
Require stack:
- /app/server.js

Error: Cannot find module 'morgan'
Require stack:
- /app/server.js

Missing Packages:
-----------------
1. compression - Required in server.js line 6
2. morgan - Required in server.js line 7

Current package.json dependencies do not include these packages.
Container exits immediately on startup due to missing dependencies.

UPDATE - Docker Build Error:
----------------------------
Date: 2025-07-07
Issue: npm ci fails during Docker build

Error: package.json and package-lock.json are out of sync
The following packages were added to package.json but are missing from package-lock.json:
- @sentry/node@7.120.3
- aws-sdk@2.1692.0
- compression@1.8.0
- morgan@1.10.0
- sharp@0.33.5
- winston@3.17.0
Plus multiple sub-dependencies

Docker build fails at step: RUN npm ci
Solution needed: Run 'npm install' locally to update package-lock.json before building Docker image

RESOLUTION - Implemented:
-------------------------
Date: 2025-07-07
Actions taken:
1. Ran 'npm install' in backend directory
2. Successfully installed 537 packages including:
   - @sentry/node
   - aws-sdk
   - compression
   - morgan
   - sharp
   - winston
3. package-lock.json updated and ready for commit

Note: Some deprecation warnings were shown:
- multer 1.x has vulnerabilities (should upgrade to 2.x)
- Several other packages have newer versions available

Status: RESOLVED - package.json and package-lock.json are now in sync
Next step: Commit both files together and rebuild Docker image
