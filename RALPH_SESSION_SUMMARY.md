## Recommendations

### Option 1: Create Clean Branch
```bash
# Create new branch from before workflow changes
git checkout 31d46d3
git checkout -b develop-clean

# Cherry-pick non-workflow commits
git cherry-pick 1faedc3 259ade8 b32b5da 3e2f3e8 9666b78 609c133 59b26b4 f97f830 6bf099a eb45494 b5d7e9f d930c8a

# Push clean branch
git push origin develop-clean
```

### Option 2: Manual Application
All changes are documented and can be manually applied by someone with proper GitHub permissions.

### Option 3: Force Push (Not Recommended)
Could remove workflow changes, but would lose commit 79052b5 which fixes growth routes.
