# DevOps Engineering Best Practices

## Core Principles

### 1. Infrastructure as Code
- Everything must be codified and version controlled
- No manual server configuration
- Reproducible deployments every time

### 2. Fail Fast, Fix Early
- Test deployments locally before handoff
- Validate all prerequisites programmatically
- Never rely on "it should work"

### 3. Clear Separation of Concerns
- DevOps: Infrastructure, containers, deployment automation
- Software: Application code, dependencies, business logic
- Infrastructure: Running deployments, monitoring, maintenance

## Container Best Practices

### 1. Image Building
```dockerfile
# GOOD: Specific versions, minimal base
FROM node:20-alpine

# BAD: Latest tag, bloated base
FROM node:latest
```

### 2. Layer Optimization
- Combine RUN commands to minimize layers
- Order from least to most frequently changing
- Clean package caches in the same layer as installs

### 3. Security
- Always run as non-root user (UID > 10000)
- No secrets in images - use runtime injection
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Use official base images from trusted sources

### 4. Multi-Stage Builds
```dockerfile
# Build stage - includes build tools
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
RUN npm ci && npm run build

# Production stage - minimal runtime
FROM node:20-alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
```

## Configuration Management

### 1. Environment Variables
- Use env_file for Docker Compose
- Override only what's necessary (database URLs for container networking)
- Document all required variables
- Provide sensible defaults where possible

### 2. Never Mix Configurations
```yaml
# BAD: Both env_file and environment with same vars
env_file: .env
environment:
  JWT_SECRET: ${JWT_SECRET}  # This overrides env_file!

# GOOD: Use env_file, override only networking
env_file: .env
environment:
  DATABASE_URL: postgresql://${DB_USER:-dbuser}:${DB_PASSWORD:-dbpass}@postgres:5432/db
```

## Deployment Documentation

### 1. Instructions Must Be Bulletproof
- Single command deployment
- No troubleshooting section needed
- If it needs debugging, it's not ready

### 2. Provide Validation Scripts
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# validate-deployment.sh
# Check all prerequisites before deployment
# Exit with clear error messages
```

### 3. Document What, Not How to Fix
- State architecture clearly
- List all services and ports
- Explain container relationships
- Don't include workarounds

## Automatic Bug Logging

### 1. Structured Error Tracking
```markdown
ISSUE: <Clear problem statement>
Date: <ISO date>
Priority: <CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW>

Current Behavior:
- What happens
- Error messages
- Impact on system

Root Cause:
- Why it happens
- Configuration or code issue

Required Action:
- Who needs to fix it (DevOps/Software/Infra)
- Specific steps needed

Status: <NEW/IN_PROGRESS/RESOLVED>
```

### 2. Categorize Issues
- **DevOps Issues**: Docker configs, networking, deployment scripts
- **Software Issues**: Missing dependencies, code bugs, architecture
- **Infrastructure Issues**: Resource limits, hardware, connectivity

### 3. Maintain Chain of Responsibility
- Log the issue immediately when discovered
- Assign to appropriate team
- Update status when resolved
- Never delete history

## Testing & Validation

### 1. Pre-Flight Checks
- Validate all prerequisites before deployment
- Check ports, disk space, required files
- Verify images are built and tagged correctly
- Ensure configuration files exist

### 2. Health Checks
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
```

### 3. Rollback Strategy
- Keep previous image versions
- Document rollback commands
- Test rollback procedure

## Monitoring & Logging

### 1. Centralized Logging
```yaml
logging:
  driver: "json-file"
  options:
    max-size: "10m"
    max-file: "3"
```

### 2. Resource Limits
```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpus: '2'
      memory: 1G
    reservations:
      cpus: '0.5'
      memory: 256M
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Configuration Errors
- ❌ Assuming env vars auto-load
- ❌ Hardcoding localhost in containers
- ❌ Missing health checks
- ✅ Always test full deployment flow

### 2. Documentation Gaps
- ❌ Incomplete deployment steps
- ❌ Missing prerequisites
- ❌ Assuming knowledge
- ✅ Document everything explicitly

### 3. Image Bloat
- ❌ Including build tools in runtime
- ❌ Not cleaning package caches
- ❌ Using full OS images
- ✅ Use Alpine, multi-stage builds

## Continuous Improvement

### 1. Post-Deployment Review
- What went wrong?
- What was missing?
- How to prevent next time?

### 2. Update Documentation
- Keep deployment instructions current
- Update after every issue
- Version control all changes

### 3. Automate Everything
- Validation scripts
- Build pipelines
- Deployment processes
- Health monitoring

## Team Communication

### 1. Clear Handoffs
- DevOps provides complete packages
- No "figure it out" instructions
- Test before handoff

### 2. Issue Escalation
- Log in error-log.txt immediately
- Tag responsible team
- Follow up on resolution

### 3. Knowledge Sharing
- Document decisions
- Explain architecture choices
- Share lessons learned

## The Golden Rule

**If deployment requires troubleshooting, DevOps has failed.**

Every deployment should be:
- One command
- Zero debugging
- 100% reproducible

When issues arise:
1. Fix the root cause
2. Update automation
3. Prevent recurrence
4. Document the solution

Remember: The goal is boring, predictable deployments that just work.
