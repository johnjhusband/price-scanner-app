# üé´ Ticket: OAuth NGINX Configuration Scripts

## Summary
Created robust OAuth fix scripts to manage and enforce OAuth NGINX config updates for staging and production environments.

## Problem
- OAuth routes missing from nginx configuration on staging and production
- Automated deployments couldn't modify nginx configs due to permission issues
- Previous scripts failed silently without proper error reporting

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created `scripts/apply-staging-oauth-fix.sh`
- Conditionally applies OAuth config if it doesn't already exist
- Includes comprehensive logging and debugging output
- Performs curl-based endpoint verification (expects 302)
- Provides clear success/failure messages

### 2. Created `scripts/force-staging-oauth-fix.sh`
- Forcefully rewrites NGINX config with OAuth location block
- Always updates, even if OAuth routes appear to exist
- Used for staging and production prep to ensure consistency
- Includes detailed debugging and verification steps

### 3. Updated `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`
- Runs OAuth fix script immediately after code pull
- Includes OAuth status curl check in deployment
- Logs outputs clearly for validation and debugging
- Already runs as root via SSH, no sudo needed

## OAuth Location Block Added
```nginx
location /auth {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

## Production Preparation
- Scripts are reusable for production deployment
- Ensure app.flippi.ai has writable NGINX config or proper permissions
- Run force script before cutover to guarantee working OAuth redirect

## Verification Steps
```bash
# Check staging OAuth
curl -I https://green.flippi.ai/auth/google
# Should return: HTTP/2 302

# Check production OAuth
curl -I https://app.flippi.ai/auth/google
# Should return: HTTP/2 302
```

## Status
- ‚úÖ Scripts created and tested
- ‚úÖ Deployment workflow updated
- ‚è≥ Awaiting deployment execution
- ‚è≥ Production deployment pending
