# üé´ Ticket #004: Remove Sudo from OAuth Fix Scripts

## Summary
Remove sudo privilege escalation from OAuth fix scripts to ensure compatibility with CI/CD environment.

## Problem
- Scripts contained internal sudo escalation logic
- Auto-escalating to sudo is unreliable in CI/CD environments
- GitHub Actions doesn't permit internal privilege escalation
- Creates inconsistency in script execution

## Code Removed
The following code block was removed from scripts:
```bash
if [ ! -w "$NGINX_CONFIG" ] && [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Need sudo access to modify nginx config"
    exec sudo "$0" "$@"
fi
```

## Solution
- Scripts now assume they're running with appropriate permissions
- Deployment workflows must explicitly invoke scripts with sudo if needed
- GitHub Actions SSH connection already runs as root

## Updated Scripts
- `scripts/fix-staging-oauth-verbose.sh`
- `scripts/apply-staging-oauth-fix.sh`
- `scripts/force-staging-oauth-fix.sh`
- `scripts/update-staging-nginx-oauth.sh`

## Best Practices
- Security: No internal privilege escalation in automated scripts
- Clarity: Permissions explicitly managed by calling process
- Auditability: Clear permission requirements in deployment logs

## Verification
Scripts should run successfully when called by deployment workflow:
```bash
# Workflow runs as root via SSH
bash scripts/fix-staging-oauth-verbose.sh
# NOT: sudo bash scripts/fix-staging-oauth-verbose.sh (redundant)
```

## Status
- ‚úÖ Sudo logic removed from all scripts
- ‚úÖ Scripts assume proper permissions
- ‚úÖ Deployment workflow runs as root
