# üé´ Ticket: OAuth Deployment Workflow Updates

## Summary
Updated staging deployment workflow to automatically apply OAuth nginx configuration during deployments.

## Problem
- OAuth configuration was not being applied during automated deployments
- Manual intervention was required after each deployment
- Scripts existed but weren't being executed properly

## Changes Made

### 1. Deployment Workflow Integration
The staging deployment workflow now:
- Executes OAuth fix scripts after pulling latest code
- Checks for multiple script variations to ensure compatibility
- Logs OAuth status after deployment
- Continues deployment even if OAuth fix fails (non-blocking)

### 2. Script Execution Order
```bash
# After git pull, the workflow checks for scripts in this order:
1. scripts/fix-staging-oauth-verbose.sh
2. scripts/fix-staging-nginx-oauth.sh
3. scripts/apply-staging-oauth-fix.sh
4. scripts/force-staging-oauth-fix.sh
```

### 3. OAuth Verification
After running the fix script, deployment automatically:
- Checks OAuth endpoint status
- Logs whether it returns 302 (success) or other status
- Provides clear success/failure messages

## Key Points
- Workflow already runs as root via SSH
- No sudo required within scripts
- Scripts must handle their own error checking
- OAuth fix is non-blocking to prevent deployment failures

## Testing
After deployment completes:
```bash
# Verify OAuth is working
curl -I https://green.flippi.ai/auth/google
# Expected: HTTP/2 302
```

## Next Steps
1. Monitor deployment logs for OAuth fix execution
2. Apply similar workflow updates to production
3. Consider adding OAuth health check to deployment validation

## Status
- ‚úÖ Workflow updated
- ‚úÖ Multiple fallback scripts provided
- ‚è≥ Awaiting deployment execution
- ‚è≥ Production workflow update pending
