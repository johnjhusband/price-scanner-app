**Release Date**: 2025-08-12  
**Environment**: blue.flippi.ai (Development)  
**Status**: ✅ QA Approved - Ready for Staging

## Overview

Release 005 introduces the Reddit Automation MVP, transforming Flippi.ai into a content generation platform that automatically creates SEO-optimized blog posts from Reddit thrift store finds.

## Core Features

### 1. Reddit RSS Integration
- Fetches ALL posts with images from r/ThriftStoreHauls (not just valuation keywords)
- Uses RSS feeds to bypass API rate limits
- Monitors multiple subreddits for content
- Stores posts in SQLite database for processing

### 2. Blog Post Generation System
- Creates SEO-optimized valuations at `/value/{slug}`
- Includes Schema.org structured data
- Automatic image processing and hosting
- Meta tags for social sharing
- Mobile-responsive design

### 3. Manual Selection Interface
- Located at `/growth/questions`
- Dropdown to select different subreddits
- Visual card layout with post previews
- One-click blog post creation
- Status tracking (New/Processed)

### 4. Growth Dashboard Integration
- New "Questions" tab in Growth modal
- Shows automation statistics
- Direct navigation to manual selection
- Real-time post monitoring

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Routes
- `/api/automation/posts/available` - Fetch unprocessed Reddit posts
- `/api/automation/create-blog/:postId` - Create blog from specific post
- `/growth/questions` - Manual selection interface
- `/value/:slug` - Public blog post pages

### Database Schema
```sql
- reddit_questions: Stores fetched Reddit posts
- valuations: Stores generated blog content
- valuation_platforms: Links valuations to marketplaces
```

### Infrastructure Updates
- **Nginx Configuration**: Git-based management in `infra-nginx/`
- **Route Order**: Growth routes added before SPA catch-all
- **Deployment Scripts**: `deploy-nginx.sh` and `restore-nginx.sh`
- **Immutable Configs**: Protected with `chattr +i`

## Known Issues

1. **UI Display Limitation**: Shows only 3 posts in interface (API returns 19)
2. **No Public Index**: Blog posts exist but no browse page
3. **Image State**: Content tab image initialization pending
