# QA Checklist for Release-001 on Blue Environment

**Release**: release-001  
**Environment**: blue.flippi.ai  
**Deployment Date**: August 3, 2025  
**Deployment Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Deployment Summary

Release-001 has been successfully deployed to blue.flippi.ai. This release includes:
- Authentication route restoration (Issue #84)
- Stricter authenticity scoring (Issue #81)
- Console.log cleanup (Issue #82)
- Legal document trademark additions (Issue #80)

## Health Check Results

### ✅ Core Services
- **Health Endpoint**: `200 OK` - Version 2.0 confirmed
- **Main Page**: `200 OK` - Application loads successfully
- **OAuth Endpoint**: `302 Redirect` - Google authentication working correctly
- **Backend Service**: Running on port 3002
- **Frontend Service**: Running on port 8082

### ⚠️ Issues Requiring Attention

1. **Legal Pages**: Currently serving React app instead of static HTML
   - `/terms`: Returns 200 but shows main app
   - `/privacy`: Returns 200 but shows main app
   - Static files exist in `mobile-app/` directory
   - Express middleware is configured but may have routing priority issue

2. **Console.log Statements**: 13 remain in backend (down from 30+)
   - Mostly initialization and server startup logs
   - Frontend successfully cleaned (0 console.logs)

3. **Trademark Symbols**: Not found in legal documents
   - May need manual addition to terms.html and privacy.html

## Feature Verification Status

### ✅ Working Features
- Google OAuth authentication
- Image upload functionality
- Health monitoring endpoint
- Basic API endpoints

### ⚠️ Partially Working
- Legal pages (accessible but wrong content)
- Authenticity scoring (implemented but needs testing)

### ❌ Not Verified
- Actual authenticity score strictness (needs test cases)
- Trademark presence in legal documents

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Fix Required**:
   - Debug why legal pages middleware isn't serving static files
   - May need to adjust routing order in server.js

2. **Testing Required**:
   - Upload test images to verify stricter authenticity scoring
   - Compare scores before/after release-001

3. **Minor Cleanup**:
   - Remove remaining console.log statements for production
   - Add trademark symbols to legal documents if missing

## Test Cases for Boca

### 1. Authentication Test
- [ ] Visit https://blue.flippi.ai
- [ ] Click "Login with Google"
- [ ] Verify redirect to Google OAuth
- [ ] Complete login flow
- [ ] Verify user info displays correctly

### 2. Image Analysis Test
- [ ] Upload a luxury item image
- [ ] Verify authenticity score appears
- [ ] Check if score seems appropriately strict
- [ ] Test with obvious fake item (should score <30%)

### 3. Legal Pages Test
- [ ] Navigate to https://blue.flippi.ai/terms
- [ ] Should see Terms of Service (currently broken)
- [ ] Navigate to https://blue.flippi.ai/privacy
- [ ] Should see Privacy Policy (currently broken)

### 4. Performance Check
- [ ] Open browser console
- [ ] Verify minimal/no console.log outputs
- [ ] Check page load time
- [ ] Test image upload speed

## Next Steps

1. **Fix legal pages routing** - Critical for compliance
2. **Verify authenticity scoring** - Test with known fake items
3. **Complete console.log removal** - Clean remaining 13 statements
4. **Add trademark symbols** - Update legal documents
