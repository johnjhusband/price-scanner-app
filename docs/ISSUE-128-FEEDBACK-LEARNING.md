# ðŸ§  Issue #128: Implement Feedback Learning Features

## Summary
Build practical learning mechanisms that turn user feedback into actionable improvements. Focus on pattern detection, manual overrides, and automated reporting.

## Features to Implement

### 1. Pattern Detection Rule Engine
- Monitor for 10+ complaints about the same issue
- Auto-flag brands or features that need review
- Send notifications when patterns emerge
- Track: value_accuracy, authenticity_concern, platform_suggestion issues

### 2. Admin Manual Override System
- Configuration table for price/score adjustments
- Examples:
  - "Reduce Gucci prices by 15%"
  - "Increase penalty for missing box label by 20 points"
  - "Boost Nike trending scores by 10"
- Apply overrides during analysis
- Track which overrides are active

### 3. Weekly Auto-Summary Reports
- Cron job runs every Sunday
- Generates report with:
  - Total feedback count
  - Most common issues by category
  - Most affected brands
  - Trending problems
  - Success rate changes
- Email to admins or display in dashboard

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Pattern Detection
1. Create pattern_detection table
2. Add detection logic to feedback analyzer
3. Flag issues when threshold (10+) is reached
4. Add notification system

### Phase 2: Manual Overrides
1. Create overrides table
2. Add admin UI for creating/managing overrides
3. Modify analysis logic to apply overrides
4. Log override applications

### Phase 3: Weekly Reports
1. Create report generation service
2. Add cron job for weekly execution
3. Generate formatted summaries
4. Add email/dashboard delivery

## Success Criteria
- Patterns detected within 24 hours of threshold
- Overrides apply immediately to new analyses
- Weekly reports delivered every Sunday at 9 AM
- Measurable improvement in user satisfaction

## Technical Details
- Use existing feedback_analysis data
- Store patterns and overrides in SQLite
- Implement as backend services
- Add UI components to admin dashboard
