## Model Comparison (2025 Pricing)

| Model | Input Cost | Output Cost | Context | Pros | Cons |
|-------|------------|-------------|---------|------|------|
| **GPT-4o-mini** | $0.15/1M | $0.60/1M | 128K | • Cheapest option<br>• Better than GPT-3.5<br>• Good for our use case | • Less capable than GPT-4o |
| **GPT-4o** | $3.00/1M | $10.00/1M | 128K | • Best vision capabilities<br>• Most accurate<br>• Latest knowledge | • 20x more expensive<br>• Overkill for our needs |
| **GPT-3.5-Turbo** | $0.50/1M | $1.50/1M | Variable | • Well-tested<br>• Stable | • More expensive than 4o-mini<br>• Less capable |

## Cost Analysis for Flippi.ai

### Current Usage Pattern
- Average request: ~500 tokens input (image + prompt)
- Average response: ~200 tokens output
- Estimated 1,000 scans/day

### Monthly Cost Projections

**GPT-4o-mini (Current)**
- Input: 1,000 × 30 × 500 = 15M tokens × $0.15 = $2.25
- Output: 1,000 × 30 × 200 = 6M tokens × $0.60 = $3.60
- **Total: $5.85/month**

**GPT-4o (Premium)**
- Input: 15M tokens × $3.00 = $45.00
- Output: 6M tokens × $10.00 = $60.00
- **Total: $105.00/month** (18x more expensive)

**GPT-3.5-Turbo**
- Input: 15M tokens × $0.50 = $7.50
- Output: 6M tokens × $1.50 = $9.00
- **Total: $16.50/month** (2.8x more expensive)

## Recommendation

**Stay with GPT-4o-mini** because:

1. **Best Value**: 70% cheaper than GPT-3.5-Turbo while performing better
2. **Sufficient Capability**: Handles our image analysis needs well
3. **Multimodal**: Strong vision capabilities for item analysis
4. **Context Window**: 128K tokens is more than enough

**Consider GPT-4o only if**:
- Users report significantly inaccurate valuations
- We need more nuanced brand/authenticity detection
- Revenue justifies 18x cost increase

## Performance vs Cost Analysis

For a 50% better result at 25% more cost threshold:
- GPT-4o is ~18x more expensive (1700% increase)
- Performance gain unlikely to be 50% for our use case
- **Does not meet criteria**

## Adding Search Capabilities

Unfortunately, OpenAI models cannot search the web in real-time through the API. However, we can:

1. **Improve prompts** with current market context
2. **Use function calling** to integrate external APIs
3. **Cache and learn** from user feedback
4. **Periodic prompt updates** with market trends

## Next Steps

1. Monitor accuracy with current GPT-4o-mini
2. A/B test with GPT-4o on subset of users
3. Collect feedback to quantify performance difference
4. Consider hybrid approach for high-value items
