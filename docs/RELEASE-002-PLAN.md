4. Get stakeholder approval

### Phase 2: Staging

## ⚠️ Rollback Strategy for Blue Environment

### Pre-Deployment Preparation
1. **Create backup tag BEFORE deployment**
   ```bash
   git tag -a blue-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S) -m "Backup before release-002"
   git push origin --tags
   ```

2. **Document current working commit**
   ```bash
   git log -1 --oneline > release-002-rollback-info.txt
   echo "Current working commit on blue: $(git rev-parse HEAD)" >> release-002-rollback-info.txt
   ```

### Rollback Triggers (When to rollback)
- [ ] Login flow broken (can't authenticate)
- [ ] API calls failing (502/503 errors)
- [ ] Image upload not working
- [ ] White screen/app won't load
- [ ] Console errors preventing core functionality

### Rollback Procedure (< 5 minutes)

#### Option 1: Git Revert (Preferred - keeps history)
```bash
# On local machine
git checkout develop
git revert -m 1 HEAD  # Revert the merge
git push origin develop

# Deployment will auto-trigger
```

#### Option 2: Git Reset (Emergency - if revert fails)
```bash
# SSH to blue server
ssh root@157.245.142.145
cd /var/www/blue.flippi.ai

# Reset to backup tag
git fetch --tags
git reset --hard blue-backup-[timestamp]

# Restart services
pm2 restart dev-backend dev-frontend
```

#### Option 3: Manual Checkout (Last resort)
```bash
# Find last known good commit
git log --oneline -10

# Checkout specific commit
git checkout [good-commit-hash]

# Force PM2 restart
pm2 delete dev-backend dev-frontend
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --only dev-backend,dev-frontend
```

### Post-Rollback Verification
1. **Immediate checks (< 2 mins)**
   ```bash
   # Check services running
   pm2 status
   
   # Test health endpoint
   curl https://blue.flippi.ai/health
   
   # Check for errors
   pm2 logs dev-backend --lines 50 | grep -i error
   ```

2. **Functional checks (< 3 mins)**
   - [ ] Can load homepage
   - [ ] Can login with Google
   - [ ] Can upload image
   - [ ] Can see analysis results

### Rollback Communication
1. **Notify team immediately**
   - "Rolling back release-002 due to [issue]"
   - Share rollback commit hash

2. **Document issue**
   ```bash
   echo "Rollback performed at $(date)" >> release-002-rollback-info.txt
   echo "Issue: [describe problem]" >> release-002-rollback-info.txt
   echo "Rolled back to: $(git rev-parse HEAD)" >> release-002-rollback-info.txt
   ```

### Prevention for Next Attempt
After rollback:
1. Fix identified issues locally
2. Test the specific failure scenario
3. Add test case to prevent recurrence
4. Deploy to test environment first
