# Flippi.ai Security Overview

## Current Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- **OAuth 2.0** with Google Sign-In
- **JWT tokens** for session management
- **No passwords stored** - completely passwordless
- **HTTPOnly cookies** for token storage

### Data Protection
- **HTTPS/TLS** encryption for all traffic
- **Input validation** on file uploads (10MB limit, image MIME types only)
- **Secure file storage** with unique identifiers
- **No payment data** handled or stored

### Privacy Protection
- **Minimal data collection** - only email, name from OAuth
- **30-day data retention** for deleted accounts
- **EXIF data stripped** from uploaded images
- **No tracking cookies** or analytics

### Infrastructure Security
- **DigitalOcean** cloud hosting
- **Nginx** reverse proxy with security headers
- **PM2** process management with auto-restart
- **Regular security updates** via Ubuntu

## Compliance Status

### Currently Implemented
- ✅ Privacy Policy
- ✅ Terms of Service  
- ✅ Age restriction (13+)
- ✅ Secure authentication
- ✅ HTTPS everywhere

### Planned Improvements
- [ ] SOC 2 Type I certification (when seeking enterprise clients)
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Security headers (CSP, HSTS)
- [ ] CCPA compliance features
- [ ] Automated security scanning

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Sign in with Google's secure OAuth
