# Issue #170: Enable UFW Firewall

## Status
The firewall configuration script has been created and is ready for deployment.

## Script Location
`/scripts/enable-firewall.sh`

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have SSH access to the production server (157.245.142.145)
2. Have root or sudo access
3. Maintain a stable SSH connection during the process

### Steps to Enable Firewall

1. **Copy the script to the server:**
   ```bash
   scp scripts/enable-firewall.sh root@157.245.142.145:/tmp/
   ```

2. **SSH into the server:**
   ```bash
   ssh root@157.245.142.145
   ```

3. **Make the script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x /tmp/enable-firewall.sh
   ```

4. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   /tmp/enable-firewall.sh
   ```

5. **Verify the firewall is active:**
   ```bash
   ufw status verbose
   ```

### Expected Output
```
Status: active
Logging: on (low)
Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), disabled (routed)
New profiles: skip

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere                  # SSH
80/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere                  # HTTP
443/tcp                    ALLOW IN    Anywhere                  # HTTPS
```

### Important Notes
- The script will prompt for confirmation before enabling the firewall
- SSH access is allowed FIRST to prevent lockout
- All Node.js applications remain accessible through nginx proxy
- No additional ports need to be opened as nginx handles all web traffic

### Rollback (if needed)
If you need to disable the firewall:
```bash
ufw disable
```

### Security Benefits
- Blocks all unauthorized incoming connections
- Only allows essential services (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS)
- Protects against port scanning and unauthorized access attempts
- Reduces attack surface significantly

## Resolution
Once the firewall is enabled on the production server, Issue #170 can be closed.
