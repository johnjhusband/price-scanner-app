# OAuth Test Results - After 36 Hours

## Current Status (as of deployment 41dd8bb)

### Test Results
- **Development (blue.flippi.ai)**: ✅ Returns 302 - OAuth WORKING
- **Staging (green.flippi.ai)**: ❌ Returns 200 - OAuth NOT WORKING  
- **Production (app.flippi.ai)**: ❌ Returns 200 - OAuth NOT DEPLOYED

### Root Cause Identified

After 36 hours of investigation:

1. **Scripts update wrong location**: All scripts update `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` but nginx may be reading from different location
2. **SSL configuration missing**: The nginx config references SSL files that don't exist:
   - `/etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf` - File not found
   - This causes nginx test to fail
3. **Windows line endings**: Scripts had CRLF causing syntax errors (now fixed)
4. **sites-enabled symlink**: May not be properly configured

### Latest Deployment Log Shows

```
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test failed
open() "/etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf" failed (2: No such file or directory)
```

### Solution Required

1. Extract the CURRENT WORKING nginx configuration from the server
2. Add OAuth location block to the working config
3. Don't reference missing SSL include files
4. Test and reload

### Manual Fix Command

SSH to server and run:
```bash
cd /var/www/green.flippi.ai
bash scripts/extract-and-fix-oauth.sh
```

This script will:
- Extract the current working nginx config
- Add OAuth location block
- Test and reload
- Verify OAuth returns 302
